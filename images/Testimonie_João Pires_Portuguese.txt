I'm staying at UTT for a semester. 
I chose UTT because of it's Industrial Engineer program and because I wanted to go to France.
In Summer School it was my intention to learn Project Management which is a field I enjoy very much
and to learn French because it can be tremendously helpful. 
Of course making friends and keeping in touch with them was also a main goal.
All this goals were achived because of Summer School, it's activities and courses.
And what better way to know France and have new friends if not by Summer School?
